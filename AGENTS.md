## Summary

You are helping in a ESP IDF project made with C. The code will eventually run
on a ESP32 board.

[ESP Docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/index.html)

## Rules

- be as simple as possible in the methods and code you use
- add valid documented codes for functions and variables
- component out reusable code
- properly name variables and functions
- separate out each functionality semantic into different files
